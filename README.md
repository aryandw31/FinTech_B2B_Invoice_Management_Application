# FinTech_B2B_Invoice_Management_Application
A Full-stack Invoice Management Application using React Js, JDBC, Java Servlets with MySQL used as the Database, providing options for search and CRUD operations, among other features.

# install react 16.8
install react version 16.8 and material ui v4 and other dependencies according to the package.json file provided.

# Running the Apllication
Launch the server and run the reach application. I have used Tomcat v8.5 server running at port 8081. Running the server on a different port will require changes to be made in the react code as well.

The sql file loads over 1000000 rows into the database, and fetching all of it into the application will take ample amount of time to launch the server. I have set the limit to 10000 rows for faster loading of the application.
