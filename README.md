# FinTech_B2B_Invoice_Management_Application
A Full-stack Invoice Management Application using React Js, JDBC, Java Servlets with MySQL used as the Database, providing options for search and CRUD operations, among other features.

# sql
Import the provided sql file into your mysql database.
The sql file loads over a huge number of rows into the database, and fetching all of it into the application will take ample amount of time to launch the server. I have set the limit to load only 10000 rows into the java server for faster loading of the application.

# install react 16.8
Install react version 16.8 and material ui v4 and other dependencies according to the package.json file provided.

# Running the Apllication
Launch the java code on server and run the react application. I have used Tomcat v8.5 server running at port 8081. Running the server on a different port will require changes to be made in the react code as well.
